# Story: Comprehensive Testing for Resend API Integration and Admin UI

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a QA Engineer,
- I want a comprehensive testing strategy for the Resend API integration and Admin UI,
- So that I can ensure the feature is robust, reliable, and meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

---

### Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  A detailed unit testing strategy is defined for `src/lib/resend.ts`.
2.  A detailed integration testing strategy is defined for `src/pages/api/send-email.ts`.
4.  All defined test scenarios cover successful paths, error handling, and edge cases.
5.  The testing strategy specifies appropriate mocking techniques for each test type.

### Testing Strategy: Resend API Integration and Admin UI

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the newly implemented Resend API integration and its corresponding Admin UI in the dashboard.

---

#### 1. Unit Tests for `src/lib/resend.ts`

**Objective:** To verify the `sendEmail` utility function correctly interacts with the Resend API and handles various outcomes.

*   **Test File Location:** `tests/lib/resend.spec.ts`
*   **Framework:** Vitest
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Mocks:**
    *   Mock the `Resend` class and its `emails.send` method to control API responses without making actual network calls.
*   **Test Scenarios:**
    *   **Successful Email Send:**
        *   Verify `resend.emails.send` is called with the correct parameters (`from`, `to`, `subject`, `html`).
        *   Assert that the function returns a success object (`{ data }`) when the Resend API responds successfully.
    *   **Resend API Error:**
        *   Mock `resend.emails.send` to return an error object.
        *   Verify that the function correctly logs the error and returns an error object (`{ error }`).
    *   **Network/Unexpected Error:**
        *   Mock `resend.emails.send` to throw an unexpected error.
        *   Verify that the function catches the error, logs it, and returns an error object.

#### 2. Integration Tests for `src/pages/api/send-email.ts`

**Objective:** To verify the `/api/send-email` API route correctly processes requests, validates input, and interacts with the `sendEmail` utility.

*   **Test File Location:** `tests/api/send-email.spec.ts`
*   **Framework:** Vitest (or a suitable API testing library)
*   **Status:** Implemented and Passed
*   **Mocks:**
    *   Mock the `sendEmail` utility function (`@/lib/resend`) to control its behavior without relying on actual email sending.
*   **Test Scenarios:**
    *   **Valid POST Request (Success):**
        *   Simulate a POST request with valid `to`, `subject`, and `html` in the body.
        *   Verify that `sendEmail` is called with the correct data.
        *   Assert that the API route returns a `200` status code and the success data from `sendEmail`.
    *   **Valid POST Request (sendEmail Error):**
        *   Simulate a POST request with valid data.
        *   Mock `sendEmail` to return an error.
        *   Verify that the API route returns a `500` status code and the error details.
    *   **Missing Required Fields:**
        *   Simulate POST requests with missing `to`, `subject`, or `html`.
        *   Assert that the API route returns a `400` status code and an appropriate error message (`Missing required fields`).
    *   **Unsupported HTTP Method:**
        *   Simulate GET, PUT, or DELETE requests to the endpoint.
        *   Assert that the API route returns a `405` status code (`Method Not Allowed`).
