# Story 1.25: Implement Waitlist Confirmation Email

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a user who has joined the waitlist
- I want to receive a confirmation email
- so that I know my submission was successful and I am on the waitlist.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  Upon successful submission of the waitlist form (from `EarlyAccessModal` and `WaitlistModalLanding`), a confirmation email is sent to the provided email address via Resend.
2.  The email content is clear, confirms the waitlist subscription, and includes relevant information about Creator's Deal Hub.
3.  The email is sent from a designated project email address (e.g., `no-reply@creatorsdealhub.com`).
4.  The email sending process is asynchronous and does not block the user's form submission experience.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1): Integrate Resend API for sending emails.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Configure Resend API key securely using environment variables.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Create a utility function or service for sending emails via Resend.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 1, 4): Modify waitlist form submission logic to trigger email sending.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Update `EarlyAccessModal` and `WaitlistModalLanding` submission handlers to call the email sending utility.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Ensure email sending is non-blocking (e.g., using a serverless function or API route).
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 2, 3): Design and implement the waitlist confirmation email template.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Define email subject and body content.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Set up the sender email address.
