# Story 1.27: Implement Newsletter Subscription Confirmation Email

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a user who has subscribed to the newsletter
- I want to receive a confirmation email
- so that I know my subscription was successful.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  Upon successful newsletter subscription (e.g., via a dedicated form), a confirmation email is sent to the provided email address via Resend.
2.  The email content is clear, confirms the newsletter subscription, and includes information about what to expect from the newsletter.
3.  The email is sent from a designated project email address (e.g., `newsletter@creatorsdealhub.com`).
4.  The email sending process is asynchronous and does not block the user's subscription experience.

## Tasks / Subtasks
