# Story 1.18: Assemble Homepage (`page.tsx`)

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a developer, I want to assemble the complete homepage, so that all core components are integrated into a final, functional page.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The `src/app/(frontend)/page.tsx` file imports and renders the `Header`, `StarfieldCanvas`, `HeroSection`, `InfoSection` (multiple instances), and `Footer` components.
2.  The assembled `page.tsx` is visually identical to the `home.html` file, including all responsive behaviors and animations.
3.  All interactive elements on the homepage (buttons, modals, scroll events) function correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Import and render `Header`, `StarfieldCanvas`, `HeroSection`, `InfoSection`, and `Footer` components in `page.tsx`.
- [x] Task 2: Ensure visual identity with `home.html`.
- [x] Task 3: Verify all interactive elements function correctly.
