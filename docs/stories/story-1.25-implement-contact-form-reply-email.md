# Story 1.25: Implement Contact Form Reply Email

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a user who has submitted a contact form
- I want to receive a confirmation email
- so that I know my inquiry has been received.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  Upon successful submission of the contact form (from `ContactFormView`), a confirmation email is sent to the provided email address via Resend.
2.  The email content is clear, confirms the inquiry receipt, and provides information on next steps or expected response time.
3.  The email is sent from a designated project email address (e.g., `no-reply@creatorsdealhub.com`).
4.  The email sending process is asynchronous and does not block the user's form submission experience.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 4): Modify contact form submission logic to trigger email sending.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Update `ContactFormView` submission handler to call the email sending utility (from Story 1.24).
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Ensure email sending is non-blocking.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2, 3): Design and implement the contact form reply email template.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Define email subject and body content.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Set up the sender email address.
