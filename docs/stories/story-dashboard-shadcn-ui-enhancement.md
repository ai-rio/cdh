## Migration Strategy

### Parallel Development
1. **Phase 1**: Build new dashboard alongside existing one
2. **Phase 2**: Feature parity testing and validation
3. **Phase 3**: User acceptance testing
4. **Phase 4**: Gradual migration with feature flags
5. **Phase 5**: Deprecation of old dashboard

### Data and State Management
- Reuse existing AuthContext and user management
- Maintain existing API integrations
- Preserve performance optimizations
- Ensure seamless user experience during transition

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering with shadcn/ui components
- Role-based navigation logic
- Responsive behavior testing
- Accessibility features validation

### Integration Tests
- Navigation flow between dashboard sections
- User interaction patterns
- Component integration with existing services
- Performance benchmarks comparison

### E2E Tests
- Complete user workflows in new dashboard
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Parallel Maintenance**: Managing two dashboard implementations
  - *Mitigation*: Clear migration timeline, feature flags, automated testing

### Medium Risk
- **User Adoption**: Users adapting to new interface patterns
  - *Mitigation*: Gradual rollout, user training, feedback collection
- **Performance Impact**: Additional component complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Performance monitoring, optimization techniques

### Low Risk
- **Component Compatibility**: shadcn/ui integration with existing code
  - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing, gradual component adoption

### Audit History
- **2024-07-11**: AC12 Scope Clarification - Requirements updated to include complete Payload CMS integration and control panel replacement. Previous AC12 implementation was insufficient - requires native Payload integration, not component imports.
- **2024-07-11**: AC7 Enhanced Visual Feedback completed - Spinner, Progress, Alert, Toast, and Loading components fully implemented with comprehensive visual feedback system
- **2024-07-11**: AC10 Global Search Functionality completed - KBar command palette, search input, keyboard shortcuts, and nuqs integration fully implemented
- **2024-07-11**: AC6 Improved User Actions completed - DropdownMenu, Dialog, Form, and Toast implementations fully functional
- **2024-07-11**: AC5 Enhanced Data Display completed - DataTable, Skeleton loading states, and responsive data visualization implemented
- **2024-07-11**: Initial audit completed, Phase 2 foundation complete, identified critical missing features
- **2024-12-19**: Story created with comprehensive requirements
