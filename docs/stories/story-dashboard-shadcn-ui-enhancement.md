## Current State Analysis

### Existing Dashboard Structure
- **File**: `/src/app/(frontend)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Current Tech Stack**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, custom components
- **Current Features**:
  - Role-based tab navigation (Admin, Creator, Brand)
  - Memoized components for performance
  - Dynamic imports for code splitting
  - Basic card layouts for content sections
  - Custom TabButton components
  - Performance optimization indicators
  - User management with SmartUserManagement component
  - Email administration with ResendAdminUI

### Enhanced Requirements
- **New Location**: Independent dashboard at `src/app/(dashboard)`
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Build upon existing features with modern UI patterns
- **Component Library**: Use shadcn/ui components following next-shadcn-dashboard-starter patterns
- **Architecture**: Separate route structure with dedicated layout and folder organization

### Pain Points Identified
- Limited visual hierarchy and information density
- Basic card layouts lack advanced data display capabilities
- Custom tab implementation could benefit from professional component library
- Missing advanced dashboard patterns (sidebars, breadcrumbs, etc.)
- No data visualization components
- Limited responsive design patterns
- Monolithic structure in frontend folder
