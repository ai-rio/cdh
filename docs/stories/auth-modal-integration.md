## Epic: User Authentication System

**Story ID**: AUTH-001  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Sprint**: 1  

---

## User Story

**As a** visitor to the Creator's Deal Hub platform  
**I want to** sign up for a new account or sign in to my existing account through an intuitive modal interface  
**So that** I can access personalized features, manage my creator profile, and utilize the platform's full functionality

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Modal Display and Navigation
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am on any page of the application
- [ ] **WHEN** I click the "Login" button in the header navigation
- [ ] **THEN** the authentication modal opens with a smooth transition
- [ ] **AND** the modal displays the sign-in form by default
- [ ] **AND** I can toggle between "Sign In" and "Sign Up" views using the toggle switch
- [ ] **AND** I can close the modal by clicking the X button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the Escape key

### AC2: User Registration (Sign Up)
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am in the sign-up view of the authentication modal
- [ ] **WHEN** I enter a valid name, email address, and password
- [ ] **AND** I click the "Sign Up" button
- [ ] **THEN** a POST request is sent to `/api/users` with my registration data
- [ ] **AND** if successful, I receive a confirmation message
- [ ] **AND** my account is created in the Payload CMS Users collection
- [ ] **AND** I am automatically logged in and receive a JWT token
- [ ] **AND** the modal closes and I am redirected to the dashboard/profile page

### AC3: User Authentication (Sign In)
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am in the sign-in view of the authentication modal
- [ ] **WHEN** I enter my registered email address and password
- [ ] **AND** I click the "Sign In" button
- [ ] **THEN** a POST request is sent to `/api/users/login` with my credentials
- [ ] **AND** if successful, I receive a JWT token and user data
- [ ] **AND** my authentication state is updated in the application
- [ ] **AND** the modal closes and I am redirected to the dashboard/profile page

### AC4: Error Handling and Validation
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am filling out the authentication form
- [ ] **WHEN** I submit invalid or incomplete data
- [ ] **THEN** appropriate error messages are displayed inline
- [ ] **AND** the form prevents submission until all validation rules are met
- [ ] **AND** server-side errors (e.g., "User already exists", "Invalid credentials") are displayed clearly
- [ ] **AND** the form remains accessible and I can correct errors without losing other entered data

### AC5: Session Management
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am successfully authenticated
- [ ] **WHEN** I navigate through the application
- [ ] **THEN** my authentication state persists across page refreshes
- [ ] **AND** my JWT token is automatically included in API requests
- [ ] **AND** I can access protected routes and features
- [ ] **AND** I can log out, which clears my session and redirects me to the home page

### AC6: Security and Best Practices
- [ ] **GIVEN** I am using the authentication system
- [ ] **WHEN** I interact with the login/signup forms
- [ ] **THEN** my password is never stored in plain text
- [ ] **AND** all API communications use HTTPS
- [ ] **AND** JWT tokens have appropriate expiration times
- [ ] **AND** sensitive operations require re-authentication
- [ ] **AND** the system protects against common attacks (XSS, CSRF)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

#### AuthModal Component Enhancement
**File**: `/src/app/(frontend)/components/AuthModal.tsx`

**Current State Analysis**:
- ✅ Modal structure and styling implemented
- ✅ Form state management (email, password, name)
- ✅ Toggle between sign-in/sign-up views
- ✅ Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- ❌ API integration with Payload CMS
- ❌ Error handling and validation
- ❌ Loading states and user feedback
- ❌ Session management integration

**Required Enhancements**:
1. **API Integration Service**
   ```typescript
   // Create authentication service
   const authService = {
     login: async (email: string, password: string) => {
       const response = await fetch('/api/users/login', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
       });
       return response.json();
     },
     register: async (name: string, email: string, password: string) => {
       const response = await fetch('/api/users', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify({ name, email, password })
       });
       return response.json();
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Enhanced Form Handling**
   - Replace console.log with actual API calls
   - Add loading states during API requests
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add form validation (email format, password strength)

3. **State Management Integration**
   - Connect to global authentication context
   - Update user session state on successful auth
   - Handle token storage and management

#### Authentication Context
**File**: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (New)

```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  token: string | null;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  register: (name: string, email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### Backend Integration

#### Payload CMS Configuration
**File**: `/src/collections/Users.ts`

**Current Configuration**:
- ✅ Basic auth enabled (`auth: true`)
- ✅ Email as title field
- ❌ Additional user fields (name, profile data)
- ❌ Email verification setup
- ❌ Custom validation rules

**Required Enhancements**:
```typescript
export const Users: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'users',
  auth: {
    tokenExpiration: 7200, // 2 hours
    verify: true, // Enable email verification
    maxLoginAttempts: 5,
    lockTime: 600 * 1000, // 10 minutes
  },
  admin: {
    useAsTitle: 'email',
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'name',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'role',
      type: 'select',
      options: [
        { label: 'Creator', value: 'creator' },
        { label: 'Brand', value: 'brand' },
        { label: 'Admin', value: 'admin' },
      ],
      defaultValue: 'creator',
    },
    // Email and password fields are automatically added
  ],
};
```

#### API Endpoints (Auto-generated by Payload)
- `POST /api/users` - User registration
- `POST /api/users/login` - User login
- `POST /api/users/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/users/refresh-token` - Refresh JWT token
- `POST /api/users/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/users/reset-password` - Password reset

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Payload CMS Users collection configuration
- JWT token management system
- Email service integration (for verification)
- Global state management solution

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: JWT token security and storage
  - **Mitigation**: Use HTTP-only cookies for token storage, implement proper token rotation

- **Risk**: API rate limiting and abuse prevention
  - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints, add CAPTCHA for repeated failures

- **Risk**: Email verification delivery issues
  - **Mitigation**: Integrate with reliable email service (Resend), provide alternative verification methods

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: User experience friction during registration
  - **Mitigation**: Streamline form fields, provide clear progress indicators, offer social login options
