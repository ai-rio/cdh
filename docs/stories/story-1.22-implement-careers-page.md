### Key Features Implementation

#### 1. Job Listings with Filtering
```typescript
// Job filtering and search functionality
const useJobFilter = () => {
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
    department: '',
    location: '',
    type: '',
    remote: false
  });
  
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  
  // Filter logic implementation
};
```

#### 2. Application Form with File Upload
```typescript
// Job application form with resume upload
const ApplicationForm = ({ jobId }: { jobId: string }) => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
    coverLetter: '',
    resume: null as File | null
  });
  
  // Form submission and file upload logic
};
```

#### 3. SEO Optimization
```typescript
// Dynamic metadata for job postings
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { jobId: string } }) {
  const job = await getJobPosting(params.jobId);
  
  return {
    title: `${job.title} - Careers at CDH`,
    description: job.description.substring(0, 160),
    openGraph: {
      title: `${job.title} - Join our team at CDH`,
      description: job.description,
      type: 'website'
    }
  };
}
```
