# Story 1.16: Implement Login Modal

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a user
- I want to sign in or sign up for an account via a modal
- so that I can access or register for the Creator's Deal Hub platform.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The login modal can be opened from the "Login" button in the command deck.
2.  The modal's overall appearance (background, blur effects, borders, text colors) matches the `auth-modal` styling defined in `docs/html/home.html`.
3.  The "Sign In" view is displayed by default when the modal opens.
4.  The "Sign In" form utilizes the `src/components/login.tsx` component as a base, with its elements (input fields, buttons, links) styled to align with the `home.html` aesthetic (dark background, light text, accent yellow/green for CTAs).
5.  Email and password input fields are present and functional within the "Sign In" view.
6.  The "Launch Command Center" button in the "Sign In" view is styled with the `cta-glow` effect and uses the `bg-[#EEFC97]` and `text-[#1D1F04]` colors.
7.  Social login buttons (Google, Apple) are present in the "Sign In" view and are styled similarly to the `social-icon-btn` in `home.html`.
8.  The "OR" separator in the "Sign In" view matches the `home.html` style.
9.  The "Don't have an account?" link is present and correctly switches the modal to the "Sign Up" view.
10. The "Sign Up" view can be toggled from the "Sign In" view and vice-versa.
11. The "Sign Up" form utilizes the `src/components/login.tsx` component as a base, with its elements (input fields, buttons) styled to align with the `home.html` aesthetic.
12. Name, email, and password input fields are present and functional within the "Sign Up" view.
13. The "Create My Account" button in the "Sign Up" view is styled with the `cta-glow` effect and uses the `bg-[#EEFC97]` and `text-[#1D1F04]` colors.
14. The "By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service" text is present in the "Sign Up" view and styled appropriately.
15. The modal can be closed via the close button from both "Sign In" and "Sign Up" views.

## Dev Notes

The primary goal is to integrate the existing `src/components/login.tsx` (which uses shadcn components) into a modal structure that visually mimics the `auth-modal` section of `docs/html/home.html`. Pay close attention to the CSS classes and inline styles in `home.html` for colors, backgrounds, borders, and blur effects.

**Key styling elements from `home.html` to adapt:**
-   **Modal Container:** `background-color: rgba(23, 23, 23, 0.7); backdrop-filter: blur(25px); border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); border-radius: 1.5rem;`
-   **Input Fields:** `background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05); border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);`
-   **CTA Buttons:** `cta-glow` class, `bg-[#EEFC97]`, `text-[#1D1F04]`
-   **Social Buttons:** `social-icon-btn` class, `background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05); border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);`
-   **Toggle Switch:** `auth-toggle-bg`, `auth-toggle-slider`, `auth-toggle-button` classes.
-   **Text Colors:** Predominantly `#f3f3f4`, `#e4e4e7`, `#a1a1aa`, `#111111` (for active toggle button text).

**Relevant Source Tree info:**
-   `docs/html/home.html`: Source for visual styling and modal behavior reference.
-   `src/components/login.tsx`: Base component for login/signup forms.
-   `src/components/ui/`: Directory containing shadcn UI components (Button, Input, Label).

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] Jest with in memory db Integration Test (Test Location): location: `/tests/components/login-modal.test.ts`
- [x] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/login-modal.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Open the application in a browser.
- Click the "Login" button in the header (command deck).
- Verify the modal opens with the correct styling and the "Sign In" view active.
- Test input fields for email and password.
- Click the "Sign Up" toggle button and verify the view switches correctly with updated fields.
- Test input fields for name, email, and password in the "Sign Up" view.
- Verify the styling of all buttons (CTA, social, toggle) matches `home.html`.
- Click the close button to ensure the modal closes.
- Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window.
