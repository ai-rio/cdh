# Story 2: Enhanced Authentication Integration

**Priority:** High | **Story Points:** 5 | **Sprint:** 1

## User Story

**As a** user  
**I want** seamless authentication that works across all dashboard features  
**So that** I can securely access and manage content based on my role

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Authentication state is synchronized between auth-service and payload-client
- [ ] Role-based access control is enforced throughout dashboard
- [ ] Session management handles token refresh automatically
- [ ] Login/logout works consistently across all components
- [ ] Authentication persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are properly handled
- [ ] User roles determine available dashboard features

## Technical Requirements

### Security Requirements
- JWT tokens must be securely stored
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Role-based route protection
- Session timeout handling
- CSRF protection implementation

### Performance Requirements
- Authentication check < 50ms
- Token refresh < 200ms
- Login process < 1 second

## Tasks

### Task 2.1: Create Unified Auth Hook (2 points)
**Estimated Time:** 1 day

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create comprehensive authentication hook
2. Bridge auth-service with payload-client
3. Implement role-based access control
4. Add session persistence and refresh logic

#### Files to Create
- `src/app/(dashboard)/hooks/use-payload-auth.ts`
- `src/lib/auth-types.ts`
- `src/lib/role-permissions.ts`

#### Key Hook Methods
```typescript
interface UsePayloadAuth {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  refreshToken: () => Promise<void>;
  hasPermission: (permission: string) => boolean;
  hasRole: (role: string) => boolean;
}
```

#### Unit Tests Required
- `tests/hooks/use-payload-auth.test.ts`
- Test authentication state management
- Test role-based access control
- Test token refresh logic
- Test error handling scenarios

### Task 2.2: Enhance Authentication Context (2 points)
**Estimated Time:** 1 day

#### Implementation Steps
1. Modify existing AuthContext to use payload-client
2. Add role-based permission checking
3. Implement automatic token refresh
4. Add authentication state persistence

#### Files to Modify
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `src/lib/auth-service.ts` (add payload integration)

#### Context Enhancements
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  // Existing properties
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  
  // New properties
  permissions: string[];
  roles: string[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  lastActivity: Date;
  
  // Enhanced methods
  login: (credentials: LoginCredentials) => Promise<AuthResult>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  checkPermission: (permission: string) => boolean;
  refreshSession: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Integration Tests Required
- `tests/integration/auth-context.test.ts`
- Test context provider functionality
- Test authentication flow
- Test permission checking
- Test session management

### Task 2.3: Update Dashboard Layout (1 point)
**Estimated Time:** 0.5 days

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add authentication guards to layout
2. Implement role-based navigation
3. Add user profile integration
4. Handle authentication loading states

#### Files to Modify
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`

#### Layout Enhancements
- Authentication guard wrapper
- Role-based menu rendering
- User profile dropdown
- Loading states for authentication

#### Unit Tests Required
- `tests/components/dashboard-layout.test.tsx`
- Test authentication guards
- Test role-based rendering
- Test loading states

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All authentication flows work seamlessly
- [ ] Role-based access control is enforced
- [ ] Token refresh works automatically
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 85%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] No authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing auth-service functionality
- Payload-client authentication methods
- User roles defined in Payload CMS

### External Dependencies
- JWT handling libraries (already installed)
- Secure storage utilities
- Role permission definitions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run authentication unit tests
pnpm test:unit src/hooks/use-payload-auth
pnpm test:unit src/contexts/AuthContext

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:unit --coverage src/hooks/use-payload-auth
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run authentication integration tests
pnpm test:integration auth-flow
pnpm test:integration role-based-access

# Run security tests
pnpm test:security auth
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login with valid credentials works
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials fails appropriately
- [ ] Logout clears all authentication state
- [ ] Token refresh works before expiration
- [ ] Role-based navigation shows correct items
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- [ ] Session persists across browser refresh

## Security Testing

### Security Test Cases
1. **Token Security**
   - Verify JWT tokens are properly signed
   - Test token expiration handling
   - Verify secure token storage

2. **Role-Based Access**
   - Test unauthorized access attempts
   - Verify role escalation prevention
   - Test permission boundary enforcement

3. **Session Management**
   - Test session timeout handling
   - Verify concurrent session limits
   - Test session invalidation

### Security Commands
```bash
# Run security-focused tests
pnpm test:security auth-tokens
pnpm test:security role-access
pnpm test:security session-management
```

## Performance Testing

### Performance Benchmarks
- Authentication check: < 50ms
- Login process: < 1 second
- Token refresh: < 200ms
- Role permission check: < 10ms

### Performance Test Commands
```bash
# Run performance tests
pnpm test:performance auth-flow
pnpm test:performance token-refresh
```

## Rollback Plan

If authentication issues arise:
1. Revert to previous auth-service implementation
2. Disable role-based features temporarily
3. Use basic authentication without advanced features
4. Monitor authentication error rates

## Success Metrics

- Authentication success rate > 99.9%
- Token refresh success rate > 99.5%
- Role-based access working 100% correctly
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance benchmarks met
- User satisfaction with login experience > 4.5/5
