# Story 1: Core Dashboard Service Integration

**Priority:** High | **Story Points:** 8 | **Sprint:** 1

## User Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** to create a centralized dashboard service layer  
**So that** all dashboard components can efficiently interact with Payload CMS

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard service aggregates data from multiple Payload collections
- [ ] Service handles caching and performance optimization
- [ ] Unified error handling across all dashboard operations
- [ ] Service supports both local and production API modes
- [ ] All service methods are properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Service includes comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] Caching layer reduces API calls by at least 50%

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Service response time < 200ms for cached data
- Memory usage < 50MB for service layer
- Support for concurrent requests (up to 100)

### Security Requirements
- All API calls must include proper authentication
- Sensitive data must be sanitized before caching
- Rate limiting implementation for API calls

## Tasks

### Task 1.1: Create Dashboard Service Foundation (3 points)
**Estimated Time:** 1 day

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create base service class structure
2. Integrate with existing payload-client
3. Implement error handling utilities
4. Add comprehensive logging system

#### Files to Create
- `src/lib/dashboard-service.ts`
- `src/lib/dashboard-types.ts`
- `src/lib/dashboard-utils.ts`

#### Files to Modify
- `src/lib/payload-client.ts` (add dashboard-specific methods)

#### Unit Tests Required
- `tests/lib/dashboard-service.test.ts`
- `tests/lib/dashboard-utils.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 85% code coverage
- All error scenarios tested
- Mock external dependencies

### Task 1.2: Implement Data Aggregation (3 points)
**Estimated Time:** 1.5 days

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create methods to aggregate Users and Media collections
2. Implement dashboard metrics calculation
3. Add data transformation utilities
4. Create collection relationship mapping

#### Key Methods to Implement
```typescript
// Dashboard service methods
getDashboardOverview(): Promise<DashboardOverview>
getCollectionStats(): Promise<CollectionStats[]>
getUserAnalytics(): Promise<UserAnalytics>
getSystemHealth(): Promise<SystemHealth>
```

#### Unit Tests Required
- Test data aggregation accuracy
- Test metric calculations
- Test data transformation functions
- Test error handling for missing data

### Task 1.3: Add Performance Optimization (2 points)
**Estimated Time:** 1 day

#### Implementation Steps
1. Integrate React Query for caching
2. Implement request batching and deduplication
3. Add performance monitoring hooks
4. Optimize API call patterns

#### Performance Targets
- Cache hit ratio > 70%
- API call reduction > 50%
- Response time improvement > 30%

#### Integration Tests Required
- `tests/integration/dashboard-service-performance.test.ts`
- Test caching behavior
- Test request batching
- Test performance under load

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 85%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing `payload-client.ts` functionality
- Current authentication system
- Database connection stability

### External Dependencies
- React Query library installation: `pnpm add @tanstack/react-query`
- Performance monitoring tools: `pnpm add @sentry/nextjs`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests for this story
pnpm test:unit src/lib/dashboard-service
pnpm test:unit src/lib/dashboard-utils

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:unit --coverage src/lib/dashboard-service
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
pnpm test:integration dashboard-service

# Run performance tests
pnpm test:performance dashboard-service
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Service initializes correctly in development
- [ ] Service initializes correctly in production
- [ ] Caching works as expected
- [ ] Error handling displays appropriate messages
- [ ] Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to direct payload-client usage
2. Disable caching layer temporarily
3. Use fallback error handling
4. Monitor system performance closely

## Success Metrics

- Service initialization time < 100ms
- Cache hit ratio > 70%
- Error rate < 0.1%
- Memory usage stable over time
- All unit tests passing
- Integration tests passing
