## Scope

### In Scope
- Complete Payload CMS integration with existing dashboard
- Real-time data synchronization
- Enhanced user and content management
- System monitoring and analytics
- Performance optimization
- Security enhancements

### Out of Scope
- Complete UI/UX redesign (enhancement only)
- Third-party integrations beyond Payload CMS
- Mobile application development
- Advanced reporting and business intelligence

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Third-party service integrations (email, storage)

## Risks and Mitigation

### High Risk
**Risk:** WebSocket implementation complexity may impact timeline  
**Mitigation:** Implement as optional feature with graceful fallback to polling

### Medium Risk
**Risk:** Performance with large datasets  
**Mitigation:** Implement pagination, virtualization, and caching from the start

**Risk:** Authentication integration complexity  
**Mitigation:** Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Low Risk
**Risk:** Third-party dependency updates  
**Mitigation:** Pin versions and test updates in staging environment

## Assumptions

- Current Payload CMS setup is stable and properly configured
- Development team has access to all required environments
- Stakeholders are available for regular feedback and testing
- Infrastructure can handle increased load from real-time features
