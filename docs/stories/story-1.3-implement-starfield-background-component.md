# Story 1.3: Implement Starfield Background Component

## Status: Not Implemented

## Story

- As a user, I want to see the animated starfield background, so that the site has a visually engaging experience.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  The `StarfieldCanvas.tsx` component correctly encapsulates and renders the Three.js animation from `home.html` and `404_Signal_Lost.html`.
2.  The canvas is positioned as a fixed background, allowing content to scroll over it.
3.  The Three.js animation runs smoothly without performance issues.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement StarfieldCanvas.tsx component with Three.js animation.
- [ ] Task 2: Position the canvas as a fixed background.
- [ ] Task 3: Optimize Three.js animation for smooth performance.

## Dev Notes

Relevant Source Tree info:
- `src/app/(frontend)/components/StarfieldCanvas.tsx`
