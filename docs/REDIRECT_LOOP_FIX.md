# Redirect Loop Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Analysis
The application was experiencing an infinite redirect loop on the `/dashboard` route with the error:
```
ðŸš« Blocked potential redirect loop: /dashboard
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Improper Middleware Logic**: The middleware was not handling authentication properly
2. **Conflicting Redirect Logic**: Both middleware and client-side code were trying to handle redirects
3. **Missing Authentication State in Middleware**: Middleware couldn't read authentication tokens
4. **Client-side Redirect Conflicts**: Dashboard component was redirecting unauthenticated users, creating conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- **Added proper authentication logic** with protected/public route definitions
- **Implemented token checking** from cookies and headers
- **Added proper redirect logic**:
  - Unauthenticated users accessing protected routes â†’ redirect to `/`
  - Authenticated users accessing public routes â†’ redirect to `/dashboard`
- **Improved matcher configuration** to exclude API routes and static files

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component (`src/app/(frontend)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Removed client-side redirect logic** that conflicted with middleware
- **Simplified loading states** since middleware handles authentication redirects
- **Kept performance optimizations** (memoization, refs, etc.)

### 3. Enhanced AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Added cookie management** for middleware to read authentication state
- **Improved token storage** in both localStorage and cookies
- **Enhanced logout function** to properly clear cookies

## Key Changes Made

### Middleware Logic
```typescript
// Define protected and public routes
const protectedRoutes = ['/dashboard']
const publicRoutes = ['/', '/login', '/register']

// Get authentication token from cookies/headers
const token = request.cookies.get('payload-token')?.value || 
              request.cookies.get('auth_token')?.value ||
              request.headers.get('authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '')

// Redirect logic
if (isProtectedRoute && !token) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url))
}

if (isPublicRoute && token && pathname !== '/dashboard') {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url))
}
```

### Cookie Management
```typescript
// Set cookie for middleware to read
document.cookie = `auth_token=${token}; path=/; max-age=${7 * 24 * 60 * 60}; SameSite=Lax`;

// Clear cookie on logout
document.cookie = 'auth_token=; path=/; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT';
```

## Results

âœ… **Infinite redirect loop eliminated**
âœ… **Proper authentication flow restored**
âœ… **Performance optimizations maintained**
âœ… **Clean server logs without redirect warnings**

## Testing Verification

The fix was verified by:
1. Restarting the development server
2. Observing clean logs without redirect loop errors
3. Confirming proper redirect behavior:
   - `âœ… Redirecting authenticated user to dashboard from: /`
   - No more `ðŸš« Blocked potential redirect loop` messages

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Middleware handles routing, components handle UI
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Authentication state managed in one place
3. **Proper Token Management**: Cookies for server-side, localStorage for client-side
4. **Performance Optimization**: Maintained all existing optimizations
5. **Error Prevention**: Eliminated conflicting redirect logic

## Future Considerations

- Monitor authentication flow for any edge cases
- Consider implementing refresh token logic
- Add proper error boundaries for authentication failures
- Implement proper session timeout handling
