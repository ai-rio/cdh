**Context Re-establishment Prompt**

**Previous Task Summary:**
The primary task was to optimize Jest testing speed, which was experiencing significant startup overhead (reported ~60s). This led to a decision to migrate the testing framework from Jest to Vitest.

**Key Changes Implemented:**
1.  **Testing Framework Migration (Jest to Vitest):**
    *   Uninstalled Jest and all associated development dependencies (e.g., `jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`, `jest-slow-test-reporter`, `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env`, `@babel/preset-react`, `@babel/preset-typescript`, `@swc/jest`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`).
    *   Deleted Jest configuration files (`jest.config.cjs`, `.swcrc`).
    *   Installed Vitest and its core dependencies (`vitest`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `@vitest/ui`, `jsdom`).
    *   Updated `package.json` scripts to use `vitest` commands (`test`, `test:watch`, `test:ui`, `coverage`).
    *   Created `vitest.config.ts` to configure Vitest, setting `environment: 'jsdom'`, `globals: true`, and `jsx: 'react-jsx'`.
    *   Created `vitest.setup.ts` to import `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` for custom matchers and configured it in `vitest.config.ts`.

2.  **Codebase Adjustments for Vitest Compatibility:**
    *   Replaced `jest.fn()` with `vi.fn()` in `src/components/CommandDeck.test.tsx`.
    *   Added `import React from 'react';` to `src/app/(frontend)/components/Header.tsx` and `src/app/(frontend)/components/Header.test.tsx` to resolve "React is not defined" errors during Vitest runs.

3.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated all story files in the `docs/stories/` directory (e.g., `story-1.1-implement-header-component.md`, `story-1.2-implement-footer-component.md`, etc.) to replace "Jest Unit Tests" and "Jest with in memory db Integration Test" with their "Vitest" equivalents.

**Current State & Issues:**
*   **Test Performance:** Vitest tests are now passing significantly faster (around 2 seconds for the `CommandDeck.test.tsx` suite) compared to the initial Jest performance.
*   **Remaining Issues:**
    *   E2E tests (Cypress) are currently failing when run by Vitest (`cy is not defined`). These need to be properly excluded from Vitest's test runner, as Cypress has its own runner.
    *   There was a persistent "ReferenceError: React is not defined" in `Header.test.tsx` and `CommandDeck.tsx` during Vitest runs, which was addressed by adding `import React from 'react';` and configuring `jsx: 'react-jsx'` in `vitest.config.ts`.
    *   The `vitest.config.ts` file might still have some minor configuration issues related to `transform` or `include` patterns that need fine-tuning to ensure all relevant files are processed correctly without errors.

**Current Git Branch:** `feature/implement-header-component`
**Uncommitted Changes:** There are uncommitted changes on the current branch related to the Vitest migration and fixes. These need to be committed before switching branches or performing further operations.

**Next Steps (Proposed):**
1.  **Commit current changes** on `feature/implement-header-component`.
2.  **Refine `vitest.config.ts`**: Ensure E2E tests are correctly excluded and that all necessary files are transformed without errors.
3.  **Verify all tests pass** on `feature/implement-header-component`.
4.  **Consider merging** `feature/implement-header-component` into `main` once tests are stable.
