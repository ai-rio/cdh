# End-to-End (E2E) Testing Strategy

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the strategy for End-to-End (E2E) testing within the Creator's Deal Hub project. The primary goal is to define a balanced approach that ensures the consistency and reliability of critical user journeys without impeding development velocity.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Balance:** Achieve an optimal balance between comprehensive test coverage and development speed.
*   **User-Centric:** Focus E2E tests on validating the most critical user flows and business-critical functionalities from an end-user perspective.
*   **Test Pyramid Adherence:** E2E tests will complement, not replace, robust unit and integration testing. They reside at the top of the test pyramid, covering scenarios that cannot be adequately validated at lower levels.
*   **Efficiency:** Prioritize stable, maintainable E2E tests that provide high confidence with minimal flakiness.

## 3. E2E Test Scope (What to Test)

E2E tests will primarily cover the following high-impact, critical user journeys:

*   **User Onboarding & Authentication Flow:**
    *   **Scenario:** User navigates to the homepage, initiates a login/signup process, successfully registers a new account, logs in, and lands on an authenticated page.
    *   **Justification:** Validates the entire user lifecycle from initial interaction to authenticated state, touching multiple components and backend integration. Critical for user engagement.

*   **Waitlist/Early Access Submission & Confirmation:**
    *   **Scenario:** User fills out and submits a waitlist or early access form (from Hero section, Pricing page, or Landing Page), verifies the success message, and confirms the simulated email confirmation.
    *   **Justification:** Directly validates a primary lead generation mechanism and its integration with the email service (even if mocked/simulated).

*   **Core Marketing Page Navigation & Content Display:**
    *   **Scenario:** User navigates through the main public-facing pages (Homepage, Landing Page, Pricing, About Us, Careers, Contact Us, 404 Page) using header/footer links, verifying that each page loads, displays its primary content, and background elements (e.g., StarfieldCanvas) are present and correctly positioned.
    *   **Justification:** Ensures the core public-facing application is navigable and visually coherent, validating routing, component assembly, and overall layout.

*   **Key Interactive Feature Validation (e.g., Pricing Toggle, AI Demo):**
    *   **Scenario (Pricing):** User navigates to the Pricing page, toggles between monthly/annual billing, and verifies that prices update correctly.
    *   **Scenario (AI Demo):** User navigates to the Landing Page, interacts with the AI Co-Pilot by clicking prompt chips, and verifies that the typing animation and mock chart/text responses appear.
    *   **Justification:** Validates complex client-side interactivity that directly showcases product features and user experience.

## 4. E2E Test Stages (When to Test)

To maintain development speed while ensuring application consistency, E2E tests will be strategically executed at specific stages:

*   **Pre-Deployment / Release Candidate Stage:**
    *   **Description:** The full E2E test suite will be executed on a dedicated staging environment (production-like) for every major release candidate or before any deployment to the production environment.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide high confidence that the entire application is stable, functional, and integrated correctly in an environment closely mirroring production. This is the primary gate for production readiness.

*   **Feature Branch (Targeted / On-Demand):**
    *   **Description:** For *major* new features, significant refactors, or changes impacting critical user flows, a *subset* of relevant E2E tests may be run on the feature branch's dedicated environment. This execution will be targeted and on-demand, triggered manually by the developer or QA. This is *not* a mandatory step for every pull request.
    *   **Specific Triggers (Story Completion):** E2E tests should be considered for execution upon completion of the following stories, as they represent significant user-facing functionality or critical integrations:
        *   **Story 1.6: Implement EarlyAccessModal Component** (Validates initial lead capture flow)
        *   **Story 1.7: Implement AuthModal Component** (Validates user authentication flow)
        *   **Story 1.18: Assemble Homepage (`page.tsx`)** (Validates the primary entry point and its core components)
        *   **Story 1.19: Assemble Landing Page (`/landing/page.tsx`)** (Validates a major interactive marketing page)
        *   **Story 1.20: Implement Pricing Page (`/pricing`)** (Validates a critical conversion page, including interactive elements like billing toggle)
        *   **Story 1.22: Implement Careers Page (`/careers`)** (Validates a page with interactive modals and forms)
        *   **Story 1.23: Implement Contact Us Page (`/contact`)** (Validates a page with dynamic forms and submissions)
        *   **Story 1.24: Implement 404 Signal Lost Page (`/404_Signal_Lost`)** (Validates error handling and navigation)
        *   **Stories involving email integration (1.25, 1.26, 1.27, 1.28):** While the email sending itself might be mocked in E2E, the successful submission and display of confirmation messages should be validated.

*   **Scheduled Regression Runs (Main/Develop Branch):**
    *   **Description:** A full E2E test suite will be executed on a nightly or weekly basis on a stable integration branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
    *   **Purpose:** To proactively identify regressions introduced by merged code, ensuring the overall health and stability of the application over time.

## 5. Test Environment & Data

*   **Dedicated Environments:** E2E tests will run against dedicated, isolated environments that closely mimic production.
*   **Realistic Data:** Test data will be realistic and representative of production data, ensuring comprehensive scenario coverage. Data setup and teardown will be automated where possible.

## 6. Maintenance & Ownership

*   **Shared Responsibility:** Developers and QA will share responsibility for writing, maintaining, and debugging E2E tests.
*   **Regular Review:** E2E tests will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in application functionality and to address flakiness.
*   **Clear Reporting:** Test results will be easily accessible and provide clear, actionable feedback.
