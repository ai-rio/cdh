## 1. General Troubleshooting Steps

Before diving into specific issues, always follow these general steps:

1.  **Check Logs**: Review logs from the relevant component (frontend, backend, database) for error messages or warnings. (Refer to `error-handling-strategy.md` for logging details).
2.  **Verify Service Status**: Ensure all necessary services (frontend server, backend server, database) are running.
3.  **Check Network Connectivity**: Confirm that components can communicate with each other and with external services.
4.  **Restart Services**: A simple restart can often resolve transient issues.
5.  **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache (frontend) or application-level caches (backend) if applicable.
6.  **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are correctly set for the environment.

## 2. Frontend Issues

    *   **Payload CMS Admin UI**: Check Payload CMS logs or dashboard for internal errors.
    *   **Database Logs**: If the error points to a database issue, check database logs.
*   **Potential Solutions**:
    *   Debug backend code based on stack traces. Ensure proper error handling (refer to `error-handling-strategy.md`).
    *   Verify database connectivity and credentials.
    *   Check external API integrations if the backend relies on them.

### 3.2. Data Inconsistencies

*   **Symptoms**: Data displayed in the frontend does not match expectations or is corrupted.
*   **Diagnostic Steps**:
    *   **Payload CMS Admin UI**: Directly inspect data in the CMS.
    *   **Database Client**: Query the PostgreSQL database directly to verify data integrity.
    *   **Backend Logs**: Look for errors during data write operations or data transformations.
*   **Potential Solutions**:
    *   Review Payload CMS collection schemas and hooks for unintended data modifications.
    *   Check database migrations for any issues.
    *   Implement data validation at multiple layers.

## 4. Database Issues

### 4.1. Connection Errors

*   **Symptoms**: Backend fails to connect to the database.
*   **Diagnostic Steps**:
    *   **Backend Logs**: Look for database connection errors.
    *   **Supabase Dashboard**: Check database status, connection limits, and network configuration.
    *   **Environment Variables**: Verify database connection string and credentials.
*   **Potential Solutions**:
    *   Correct database credentials or connection string.
    *   Increase connection pool size if hitting limits.
    *   Ensure database is running and accessible from the backend environment.

### 4.2. Slow Queries

*   **Symptoms**: API endpoints that interact with the database are slow.
*   **Diagnostic Steps**:
    *   **Supabase Dashboard**: Identify slow queries using query performance insights.
    *   **`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`**: Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on problematic SQL queries to understand execution plan and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Potential Solutions**:
    *   Add or optimize database indexes.
    *   Rewrite inefficient queries.
    *   Consider caching frequently accessed data.

## 5. Deployment Issues

### 5.1. Build Failures

*   **Symptoms**: Vercel deployment fails during the build step.
*   **Diagnostic Steps**:
