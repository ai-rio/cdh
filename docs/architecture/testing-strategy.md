# **Testing Strategy**

## **Overview**
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Creator's Deal Hub project. It defines the types of tests, their purpose, and how they integrate into the development lifecycle to ensure high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

## **Testing Principles**
- **Shift Left**: Integrate testing early and continuously throughout the development process.
- **Automate Everything Possible**: Prioritize automated tests to ensure rapid feedback and reduce manual effort.
- **Layered Testing**: Implement a testing pyramid, with a strong emphasis on unit and integration tests.
- **Traceability**: Link tests back to requirements and user stories to ensure full coverage.
- **Performance and Security by Design**: Incorporate performance and security testing from the outset.

## **Types of Tests**

### **1. Unit Tests**
- **Purpose**: Verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, or components in isolation.
- **Scope**: Smallest testable parts of the application.
- **Frameworks**: Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Execution**: Automatically run on every commit (pre-commit hook) and as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Location**: Reside alongside the code they test (e.g., `src/components/MyComponent.test.tsx`) or in a `__tests__` subdirectory.

### **2. Integration Tests**
- **Purpose**: Verify that different modules or services work together correctly.
- **Scope**: Interactions between components, API endpoints, database interactions.
- **Frameworks**: Jest, Supertest (for API endpoints).
- **Execution**: Automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Location**: Typically in a `tests/integration` directory or within feature modules.

### **3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
- **Purpose**: Simulate real user scenarios across the entire application stack (frontend to backend).
- **Scope**: Critical user flows and business processes.
- **Frameworks**: Playwright.
- **Execution**: Run on staging environments as part of the CI/CD pipeline, and periodically in production.
- **Location**: `tests/e2e` directory.

### **4. Performance Tests**
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the system's responsiveness, stability, scalability, and resource usage under various workloads.
- **Scope**: Key user journeys, high-traffic APIs.
- **Tools**: K6, Lighthouse.
- **Execution**: Integrated into CI/CD for critical paths, and run periodically for comprehensive analysis.

### **5. Security Tests**
- **Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities and ensure the application is protected against common attacks.
- **Scope**: Authentication, authorization, data handling, API security.
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Snyk, manual penetration testing.
- **Execution**: Integrated into CI/CD (SAST/DAST), and performed by security specialists periodically.

### **6. Accessibility Tests (A11y)**
- **Purpose**: Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Scope**: UI components, navigation, content readability.
- **Tools**: Axe-core, Lighthouse, manual review.
- **Execution**: Integrated into component testing and manual QA.

## **Test Environment**
- **Development**: Local environment for unit and integration tests.
- **Staging**: Dedicated environment for E2E, performance, and manual QA before production deployment.
- **Production**: Monitoring and synthetic transactions to ensure ongoing health.

## **Test Data Management**
- Use consistent, anonymized, and representative test data.
- Avoid using production data directly in non-production environments.
- Implement strategies for generating or resetting test data for repeatable tests.

## **Reporting and Metrics**
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for high unit test coverage (e.g., >80%).
- **Test Pass Rate**: Monitor the percentage of passing tests.
- **Defect Density**: Track the number of defects found per unit of code.
- **Test Execution Time**: Optimize test suites for fast execution.

## **Integration with CI/CD**
All automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to provide immediate feedback on code changes and prevent regressions. A failing test will block deployment to the next environment.

## **Manual QA**
While automation is prioritized, manual QA will be performed for:
- Exploratory testing.
- Usability testing.
- Complex end-to-end scenarios not easily automated.
- Visual regression testing.

## **Definition of Done (DoD) - Testing Aspects**
For a story to be considered 'Done', the following testing criteria must be met:
- All new code has accompanying unit tests with sufficient coverage.
- Relevant integration tests are updated or created.
- E2E tests are updated or created for critical user flows.
- All automated tests pass in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Manual QA has signed off on the feature in the staging environment.
- No critical or high-severity bugs are open related to the feature.
