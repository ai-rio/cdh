# Error Handling Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive error handling strategy for the Creator's Deal Hub, covering both frontend and backend systems. The goal is to ensure consistent error detection, reporting, and resolution, providing a robust and user-friendly application.

## 1. Error Classification

Errors within the Creator's Deal Hub can be broadly classified based on their origin and impact:

*   **Client-Side Errors**: Occur in the user's browser (e.g., JavaScript runtime errors, network issues affecting frontend requests).
*   **Server-Side Errors**: Occur in the backend application (Payload CMS) or its underlying services (e.g., API route errors, business logic exceptions).
*   **API Errors**: Specific errors returned by the backend API (Payload CMS) to the frontend, often due to invalid requests, authentication/authorization failures, or resource not found.
*   **Database Errors**: Errors originating from the PostgreSQL database (e.g., connection issues, query failures, data integrity violations), typically propagated through the backend.
*   **External Service Errors**: Errors encountered when interacting with third-party APIs (e.g., social media platforms, payment gateways).

## 2. Frontend Error Handling

Frontend error handling focuses on providing a resilient user experience and capturing client-side issues.

### 2.1. Error Boundaries (React)

*   React Error Boundaries will be used to gracefully catch JavaScript errors in component trees, preventing the entire application from crashing. A fallback UI will be displayed to the user.

### 2.2. `try-catch` Blocks

*   Asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls using `fetch`) and other potentially error-prone code will be wrapped in `try-catch` blocks to handle errors locally.

### 2.3. User Feedback

*   **Toast Notifications**: For non-critical errors or transient issues (e.g., network connectivity problems), subtle toast notifications will inform the user.
*   **Error Pages**: For critical, unrecoverable errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error), dedicated error pages will be displayed, providing clear messages and options to navigate back.
*   **Form Validation**: Client-side validation will provide immediate feedback to users on invalid input, preventing unnecessary requests to the backend.

### 2.4. Client-Side Error Logging

*   Client-side errors caught by Error Boundaries or `try-catch` blocks will be logged to the browser's console during development.
*   For production, integration with a dedicated error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket - future consideration) will be used to capture, aggregate, and analyze client-side errors.

## 3. Backend Error Handling

Backend error handling ensures the stability and reliability of the Payload CMS application and provides consistent error responses to the frontend.

### 3.1. Centralized Error Handling

*   Payload CMS's built-in error handling mechanisms and custom Express middleware will be utilized to catch and process errors globally.

### 3.2. Consistent Error Responses

*   All API error responses will follow a standardized JSON format, including a clear error message, a unique error code (if applicable), and potentially additional details for debugging.
*   HTTP status codes will be used appropriately (e.g., 400 for Bad Request, 401 for Unauthorized, 403 for Forbidden, 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).

### 3.3. Payload CMS Hooks

*   Payload CMS hooks (e.g., `beforeChange`, `afterChange`) will include robust error handling to prevent data corruption and ensure transactional integrity.

### 3.4. Server-Side Error Logging

*   All server-side errors will be logged to Vercel's logging infrastructure. Detailed stack traces and request context will be captured.

## 4. API Error Handling

API error handling is a crucial bridge between the frontend and backend.

### 4.1. Standardized API Responses

*   As mentioned in Section 3.2, API errors will return consistent JSON structures, making it easier for the frontend to parse and display relevant messages.

### 4.2. Handling External API Errors

*   When the backend interacts with external APIs, robust `try-catch` mechanisms will be implemented to handle third-party service failures gracefully. These errors will be logged internally, and appropriate generic error messages will be returned to the frontend to avoid exposing sensitive details.

## 5. Database Error Handling

Database errors are managed primarily by Payload CMS and Supabase.

*   Payload CMS handles the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, translating database errors into application-level exceptions.
*   These exceptions will be caught by the backend's centralized error handling and logged.
*   Supabase provides its own monitoring and logging for database-level issues.

## 6. Logging

Effective logging is fundamental for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

### 6.1. Centralized Logging

*   All application logs (frontend and backend) will ideally be aggregated into a centralized logging system (e.g., Vercel Logs, potentially integrated with a log management platform like Datadog or Logz.io in the future).

### 6.2. Log Content

*   **Error Details**: Full stack traces, error messages, and relevant error codes.
*   **Contextual Information**: Request IDs, user IDs (if authenticated), timestamps, and relevant input parameters to aid in debugging.
*   **Severity Levels**: Logs will be categorized by severity (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).

### 6.3. Logging Tools

*   **Vercel Logs**: Primary logging mechanism for deployed applications.
*   **`console.log`**: Used for development-time debugging, but minimized in production code.

## 7. Alerting

Alerting ensures that critical issues are promptly brought to the attention of the development team.

*   **Critical Error Alerts**: Automated alerts will be triggered for high-severity errors (e.g., 5xx errors on the backend, unhandled frontend exceptions).
*   **Alerting Channels**: Notifications will be sent to designated channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty - future consideration) based on the severity and type of error.
*   **Thresholds**: Alerts will be configured with appropriate thresholds to avoid alert fatigue while ensuring timely response to genuine issues.

## 8. Monitoring

Continuous monitoring provides insights into the application's health and performance, helping to proactively identify and resolve issues.

*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Tools (e.g., Vercel Analytics, potentially New Relic or Datadog in the future) will track key metrics like response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
*   **Uptime Monitoring**: External services will monitor the application's availability.
*   **Log Monitoring**: Regular review of logs for unusual patterns or recurring errors.
*   **Database Monitoring**: Supabase dashboard provides comprehensive database performance metrics.

This robust error handling strategy ensures the Creator's Deal Hub remains stable, reliable, and provides a positive experience for its users, even when unexpected issues arise.
