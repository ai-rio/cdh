## 1. Deployment Architecture

The Creator's Deal Hub leverages a modern, cloud-native deployment architecture designed for scalability, performance, and ease of management.

### 1.1. Frontend Deployment (Next.js)

*   **Platform**: Vercel
*   **Method**: Next.js applications are deployed directly to Vercel. Vercel's platform provides automatic scaling, global CDN, and serverless functions for API routes.
*   **Configuration**: Deployment is triggered by Git pushes to specified branches. Vercel automatically detects the Next.js framework and configures the build and deployment process.

### 1.2. Backend Deployment (Payload CMS)

*   **Platform**: Vercel (as part of the Next.js application's API routes)
*   **Method**: Payload CMS runs within the Next.js application's API routes (`src/app/(payload)/api/`). This means the Payload CMS backend is deployed alongside the frontend on Vercel.
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase. Payload CMS connects to the Supabase PostgreSQL instance using environment variables.

### 1.3. Database (PostgreSQL)

*   **Provider**: Supabase
*   **Method**: Supabase provides a managed PostgreSQL database service. This offloads database management, backups, and scaling to Supabase.
*   **Connection**: The Payload CMS instance connects to the Supabase PostgreSQL database using a connection string provided via environment variables.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

The project utilizes an automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure rapid, reliable, and consistent deployments.

### 2.1. Tools

*   **Version Control**: Git (GitHub)
*   **CI/CD Platform**: Vercel (built-in CI/CD for Next.js applications)

### 2.2. Workflow

1.  **Code Commit**: Developers commit code changes to feature branches in the GitHub repository.
2.  **Pull Request (PR)**: A pull request is opened to merge changes into a designated integration branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
3.  **Automated Checks (CI)**:
    *   **Linting**: ESLint checks for code style and quality issues.
    *   **Type Checking**: TypeScript compiler verifies type correctness.
    *   **Unit Tests**: Automated unit tests (Jest/React Testing Library) are executed to validate individual components and functions.
    *   **Build**: The Next.js application is built to ensure it compiles without errors.
4.  **Preview Deployments**: For every pull request, Vercel automatically creates a unique preview deployment URL. This allows for easy review and testing of changes in an isolated environment before merging.
5.  **Merge to Main/Develop**: Once all checks pass and the PR is approved, changes are merged into the `main` (or `develop`) branch.
6.  **Production Deployment (CD)**:
    *   Merging to the `main` branch automatically triggers a production deployment on Vercel.
    *   The latest successful build is deployed to the production URL.

## 3. Environment Strategy

The project employs distinct environments to manage development, testing, and production workflows.

### 3.1. Environments

*   **Development (Local)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Local development and testing by individual developers.
    *   **Access**: Accessible only on the developer's machine.
    *   **Data**: Local database (e.g., Dockerized PostgreSQL) or a dedicated development Supabase instance.
    *   **Configuration**: Environment variables managed locally (e.g., `.env.local`).
*   **Preview (Vercel Preview Deployments)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Review and testing of feature branches before merging. Each PR gets a unique URL.
    *   **Access**: Accessible via unique Vercel URLs, typically shared with stakeholders for review.
    *   **Data**: Can connect to a shared staging database or a dedicated ephemeral database for isolated testing.
    *   **Configuration**: Environment variables configured in Vercel for preview deployments.
*   **Production**:
    *   **Purpose**: Live application accessible to end-users.
    *   **Access**: Publicly accessible via the main domain.
    *   **Data**: Dedicated production Supabase PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Configuration**: Production environment variables securely managed in Vercel.

### 3.2. Environment Variables

*   Sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) is stored as environment variables and injected at build/runtime by Vercel.
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is used for client-side accessible variables.

## 4. Rollback Strategy

In case of critical issues post-deployment, a clear rollback strategy is in place to minimize downtime.

### 4.1. Primary Method

*   **Git Revert**: The primary method is to revert the problematic commit in the Git repository. Vercel's CI/CD automatically detects the revert and triggers a new deployment of the previous stable version.
*   **Vercel Rollback**: Vercel provides a dashboard feature to instantly roll back to any previous successful deployment. This is a quick way to revert to a known good state.

### 4.2. Risk Mitigation

*   **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests (as defined in `testing-strategy.md`) are crucial to catch issues before deployment.
*   **Preview Deployments**: Thorough testing on preview deployments reduces the likelihood of issues reaching production.
*   **Monitoring**: Robust monitoring and alerting systems (see Section 5) enable rapid detection of post-deployment issues.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting

Effective monitoring and alerting are essential for maintaining application health and quickly responding to incidents.

### 5.1. Frontend Monitoring

*   **Vercel Analytics**: Provides insights into page views, unique visitors, and web vitals.
*   **Client-side Error Tracking**: Integration with a service like Sentry or LogRocket (future consideration) for capturing and reporting client-side JavaScript errors.
*   **Performance Monitoring**: Tools like Lighthouse CI (can be integrated into CI/CD) for tracking performance metrics (e.g., Core Web Vitals).

### 5.2. Backend Monitoring (Payload CMS)

*   **Vercel Logs**: Logs from Next.js API routes (where Payload CMS runs) are accessible in the Vercel dashboard.
*   **Payload CMS Admin UI**: Provides insights into data operations and potential errors within the CMS.

### 5.3. Database Monitoring (Supabase)

*   **Supabase Dashboard**: Provides detailed metrics on database performance, query activity, and resource utilization.
*   **Supabase Logs**: Database logs are accessible for debugging and auditing.

### 5.4. Alerting

*   **Vercel Alerts**: Configured to notify on deployment failures or critical errors.
*   **Third-party Integrations**: For more advanced alerting, integration with services like PagerDuty, Slack, or email (future consideration) can be set up to receive notifications for critical errors, performance degradation, or security incidents.

This comprehensive deployment guide ensures that the Creator's Deal Hub can be reliably and efficiently deployed and maintained.
