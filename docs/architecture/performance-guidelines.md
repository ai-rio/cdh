# Performance Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the performance guidelines for the Creator's Deal Hub, covering both frontend and backend systems. It aims to provide actionable strategies and best practices to ensure a fast, responsive, and scalable application, ultimately enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

## 1. Key Performance Metrics

Performance will be measured and optimized against key metrics, including:

*   **Core Web Vitals**: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
*   **Page Load Time**: Time taken for a page to fully load and become interactive.
*   **API Response Time**: Latency of backend API calls.
*   **Rendering Performance**: Smoothness of animations and UI interactions (e.g., consistent 60 FPS).
*   **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage on both client and server.

## 2. Frontend Performance Optimization

Frontend performance is crucial for user experience, especially on mobile devices.

### 2.1. Bundle Size Reduction

*   **Code Splitting**: Utilize Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the JavaScript needed for a particular page.
*   **Tree-Shaking**: Ensure unused code is eliminated during the build process.
*   **Lazy Loading**: Dynamically import components or libraries that are not immediately needed (e.g., `React.lazy`, dynamic imports in Next.js).

### 2.2. Image and Media Optimization

*   **Next.js Image Component**: Use `next/image` for automatic image optimization (resizing, format conversion, lazy loading, responsive images).
*   **Vector Graphics**: Prefer SVG for icons and illustrations where possible for scalability and small file sizes.
*   **Video Optimization**: Compress videos and use modern formats (e.g., WebM) with appropriate streaming techniques.

### 2.3. Rendering Performance

*   **Memoization**: Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of React components.
*   **Virtualized Lists**: For long lists of data, implement virtualization (windowing) to render only the visible items.
*   **Efficient Animations**: Optimize Three.js and GSAP animations to run smoothly at 60 FPS. Avoid animating expensive CSS properties (e.g., `width`, `height`, `left`, `top`) and prefer `transform` and `opacity`.
*   **CSS Optimization**: Minimize complex CSS selectors and avoid excessive use of `filter` or `box-shadow` on frequently repainted elements.

### 2.4. Critical Rendering Path Optimization

*   **Minimize Render-Blocking Resources**: Load critical CSS and JavaScript inline or asynchronously.
*   **Preload/Preconnect**: Use `<link rel="preload">` and `<link rel="preconnect">` for critical resources and origins.

## 3. Backend Performance Optimization

Backend performance directly impacts API response times and overall application responsiveness.

### 3.1. API Response Time Optimization

*   **Efficient Queries**: Optimize database queries to retrieve only necessary data and use appropriate indexes.
*   **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., in-memory cache, Redis - future consideration).
*   **Payload CMS Specific Optimizations**: Configure Payload CMS for optimal performance, including efficient use of hooks, access control functions, and field configurations.
*   **Minimize External Calls**: Reduce synchronous calls to external APIs where possible, or implement robust caching for their responses.

### 3.2. Serverless Function Cold Starts

*   While Vercel manages serverless functions, be mindful of cold starts for infrequently accessed API routes. Optimize function code to minimize startup time.

## 4. Database Performance Optimization

Database performance is critical for data-intensive applications.

### 4.1. Indexing Strategies

*   Ensure appropriate indexes are created on frequently queried columns (e.g., foreign keys, columns used in `WHERE` clauses, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN` conditions).

### 4.2. Query Optimization

*   Review and optimize slow queries identified through database monitoring. Avoid N+1 queries.
*   Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL to understand query execution plans.

### 4.3. Connection Pooling

*   Payload CMS and Supabase handle connection pooling, but ensure configurations are appropriate for expected load.

## 5. Network Performance

Optimizing network communication reduces latency and improves load times.

*   **CDN Usage**: Vercel's global CDN automatically serves static assets and cached content closer to users.
*   **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3**: Leverage modern HTTP protocols for multiplexing and reduced overhead.
*   **Compression**: Ensure Gzip or Brotli compression is enabled for text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

## 6. Monitoring and Testing

Continuous monitoring and regular testing are essential for maintaining performance.

*   **Performance Monitoring Tools**: Utilize tools like:
    *   **Vercel Analytics**: For frontend performance metrics and Core Web Vitals.
    *   **Lighthouse CI**: Integrate into CI/CD for automated performance audits.
    *   **Supabase Dashboard**: For database performance metrics.
    *   **Browser Developer Tools**: For profiling frontend rendering and network activity.
*   **Load Testing & Stress Testing**: Periodically conduct load tests to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify bottlenecks.
*   **End-to-End Performance Tests**: Include performance assertions in E2E tests to catch regressions.

This comprehensive approach to performance ensures the Creator's Deal Hub delivers a fast, smooth, and reliable experience for all users.
