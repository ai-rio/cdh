# Creator's Deal Hub Project Documentation

## Overview

This documentation serves as the central operational guide for the **Creator's Deal Hub**, an application specifically designed to empower micro-influencers and content creators by streamlining their administrative burdens, minimizing time inefficiencies, and mitigating burnout. It provides a structured overview of the project's architecture, technical standards, and development processes. Its core purpose is to enable AI development agents and human team members to understand the project context, conventions, and patterns for effective and consistent contributions to the codebase.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is logically organized into the following key categories:

- **Project Overview**: High-level summaries and foundational product documents.

- **Architecture**: Detailed technical specifications and design patterns for both frontend and backend systems.

- **Development & Operations**: Practical guidelines for coding, testing, deployment, and ongoing system maintenance.

- [Architecture Index](./architecture/index.md)

- [Frontend UI/UX Specification](./architecture/ui-ux-spec.md)


## Reading Order Recommendations

- **For Product Managers/Stakeholders**: Begin with the [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./prd/prd.md) to understand the project's goals, problem statement, and core requirements.

- **For Architects/System Designers**: Start with the [Architecture Index](./architecture/index.md) to grasp the overall system design before delving into specific architectural documents like [Fullstack Architecture](./architecture/fullstack-architecture.md), [Deployment Guide](./architecture/deployment-guide.md), and [Security Considerations](./architecture/security-considerations.md).

- **For Developers (Frontend)**: After reviewing the [Architecture Index](./architecture/index.md), refer to the [Frontend Architecture](./architecture/frontend-architecture.md), [UI Components](./architecture/components.md), and [Performance Guidelines](./architecture/performance-guidelines.md) documentation.

- **For Developers (Backend)**: After reviewing the [Architecture Index](./architecture/index.md), consult the [Backend Architecture](./architecture/backend-architecture.md), [Data Models](./architecture/data-models.md), and [Error Handling Strategy](./architecture/error-handling-strategy.md) documentation.

- **For QA/Testing**: See the [Testing Strategy](./architecture/testing-strategy.md) and [Troubleshooting Guide](./architecture/troubleshooting-guide.md) for an overview of testing approaches and requirements.

- **For All Contributors**: Review the [Coding Standards](./architecture/coding-standards.md) (including Git Branch Policy) for consistent development practices.
